Hi, thanks for asking for help.

currently the following commands exist:
```
$help 
	You should have already figured this one out
$remindme (s|p|w (0,1,2,3))
	Using w and then a number between 1-3 will register you for water drinking reminders. Use 0 to deregister from the bot.
	If you use the numbers 1-3 you will get more notifiers, the higher the number. The levels are:
	1 - every 2 hours (during office hours)
	2 - every hour (during office hours)
	3 - every half hour (during office hours)
	You will be reminded via direct message.
	The arguments s and w are currently not implemented, but are supposed to be single and recurring reminders.
